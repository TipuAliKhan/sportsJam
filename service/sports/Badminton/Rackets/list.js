The tenfold increase in binding force makes it possible to create a 5% higher repulsion power and 15% greater stability in Nanoray 900 SE.The slimmest racquet ever produced by Yonex vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.The control support cap provides an 88% wider flat surface compared with an ordinary racquet for easier gripping, fast follow-through and the sharpest maneuverability.Hendra Setiawan and Mohammad Ahsan stand as one of the greatest teams in the men’s doubles game. 2015 saw the world-class pair crowned as World Champions, and they would go on to win at the BWF World Superseries Finals held that same year. These weren’t firsts for them either—the duo had won both titles previously in 2013.Since 2014, the pair has been competing with the NANORAY 900. To commemorate the fine accomplishments of these two incredible athletes, Yonex is proud to present a new limited edition line of NANORAY racquets designed in the image of the dynamic Indonesian doubles duo.Frame: H.

This allows for the shaft to flex more building up the energy to transfer to the shuttle, on both smash and drive shots. Once the racquet has made contact with the shuttle the NANOMESH NEO helps the frame to return to its original state in order for you to be able to play your next shot for that attacking edge.New Grommet Pattern - The single-pass grommet hole construction provides more grommet holes for a more high-performance stringing pattern.Built-in T-Joint - Moulded deep into the layers of graphite where the frame connects with the shaft, the YONEX Built-in T-Joint creates a durable and high-strength one-piece frame that is torque-free.Control Support Cap - The control support cap provides an 88% wider flat surface compared with an ordinary racquet for easier gripping, fast follow-through, and the sharpest maneuverability.Frame: H.M.

The thinner top of the frame sides minimize air resistance for greater head speed, while the thicker sides at the bottom of the head generate maximum repulsion through greater frame stiffness.New from YONEX: ‘Nanomesh + Carbon Nanotube’ is an exclusive structural material inserted into the frame and/or shaft of the nanoray series.

      "Gosen Inferno Lite Badminton RacketGames are not won through simply exchanging long-flight rallies.Surprise your opponent with consistent distance adjustments.Control of the velocity will make your long-distance attack more effective.Welcome to a new world of defense and offense.Features in Inferno Lite RacketSuper Flexible Shaft - Gosen's Inferno Lite adopts a Super flexible shaft with its restoration limit strength improved by 10.7%. The Rigid but super-supple Flex frame matches well with the Inferno gut to ensure a smooth swing.Excellent Strength - Special structure that combines strength, power, and control. The Inferno frame's structural strength is 13% improved from conventional frames, and its torque and surface stability are also outperforming the average frame.There are some cases where players can perform perfectly in practice, but once they start a match they can no longer deliver the shuttlecock as they want.Case 1 - Possible during practice, impossible during games. Unlike in practice, the course of the shuttlecock is unpredictable in actual games, and the positioning of the shuttlecock may be insufficiently precise, which can result in a poor smash with insufficient takeback.Answer - We developed a racket that produces a great flight distance, even with a swing with a small takeback. This newly-developed racket enables the player to make a clear shot with ease, even when the positioning of the shuttlecock is inaccurate.However, a new problem arises as the flight distance performance is improved. See Case 2Case 2 - No reversal of the offense and defense situation. There will be no reversal of the offense and defense situation if you just keep exchanging long-flight rallies. To make your rally variations effective, speed-suppressed braking shots, as well as cutting and dropping shots, are essential.Conclusion - Games are not won just by flight distance.Velocity control is vital.This enables players with small takeback to achieve both long-distance shots and speed-suppressed braking shots.You can take time for the next action, such as positioning the shuttlecock, by combining your high-clear shot that flies a long distance, with a small takeback, smash return, and braking shot, the speed of which is reduced right over the net, to improve your strategic performance. In badminton, strategic performance is important. Not only the flight distance of the shuttlecock but also speed-suppressed braking shots will be a shortcut to victory.Material - MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL PYROFIL (frame & shaft) / M30Length - 675mmGrip Length - 200 mmShaft Diameter - 7.0 mmGrommets - 76 Grip Material - WoodBalance Point - 295-300mmMade in Taiwan",

      "Mizuno JPX 8 Power Badminton RacketBy careful recalibration, the JPX 8 Power's frame is compressed to provide a wider frame with steeper angles that slice quicker through the air for faster and powerful shots.- Aero HexagramThe six-pointed 'star' like frame with equilateral angles reduces air resistance and the lower frame's high-level strength increases repulsion power. The aerodynamic frame is perfect for lightning-fast shots and high-speed rallies.- Hot Melt TechThe graphite sheets heated at a higher temperature to further eliminate the impurities during the initial manufacturing process. This results in a smoother more consistent coating that not only strengthens the frame but enhances the aerodynamics of the graphite thus increasing the racquet's velocity.- Nano PEFThe shaft is constructed using 'Nano PEF' (Nano Polyethylene Fibre) which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. The characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.",
