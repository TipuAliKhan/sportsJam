The midfoot band on the upper helps to lock the foot in place creating a superb fit ensuring comfort is number one.

A BOA lacing system makes it extremely easy to secure the boots for a firm and secure fit. The ankle rises high and is especially supportive, which will provide support when you go through your bowling action. This will keep you feeling comfortable and strong in an upright position.AdiPRENE MidsoleEquipped with Adidas' technology AdiPRENE, the cricket shoes provide cushioning in abundance to the heel and forefoot while ensuring a high degree of impact absorption. adidas claims that the super technology can absorb impacts of over 5 times a person's body weight, allowing you to perform at your best without any injuries. The majority of the AdiPRENE impact protection is located in the heel, with a smaller amount in the forefoot as it is the heel that hits the ground first and the impact forces and shock run through the heel.10-Spike configuration on the outsole"
